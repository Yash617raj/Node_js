I) Cookies are domain-specific, meaning they are tied to the domain where they are set. For example:

i) If a cookie is created on localhost, it will only be accessible on localhost.
ii) Similarly, if a cookie is created on facebook.com, it will only be sent with requests to facebook.com.


II) Cookies are automatically included in every request made to the domain they belong to, regardless of the
HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).

III) We can set an custom domain & and expiry date for the cookie 

IV) Cookies work only on browser
